SQL Zoo is [a set of tutorials to help you learn SQL](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial) that progressively increases in difficulty.

Queries can be run against the tables in their database. The problems were completed using the MySQL engine as [part of the curriculum for The Odin Project, an excellent MOOC that teaches you full-stack web development.](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/databases/lessons/sql-zoo)

Among the necessary skills required, I learned:
- **SELECT** basics
- to use **pattern matching** in queries
- to work with various sets of data
  * e.g. data regarding countries and stats related to their populations
  * Nobel prize winners
  * matches and goals from one of the EUFA EURO Football Championships
  * movies, directors and castings
  * student survey data from UK higher education graduates
  * UK general elections
  * bus route data from the Edinburgh Travelmap

- use **SELECT within SELECT** for more advanced queries
- use **aggregate functions** such as:
  * AVG()
  * COUNT()
  * MAX()
  * MIN()
  * SUM()
- use **GROUP BY** to join data

- use **JOINs** (e.g. SELF JOIN, INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, etc.)
- use **CASE statements**
- handle columns containing **NULL** data

There are three questions flagged in the "extra credit" sections missing answers that I had to look at the solutions for. I did not want to claim them as my own and so they have been omitted. Additionally, the last answer for the final question (in 9 Self Join) is properly credited to StackOverflow user fish-404 [(his answer can be seen here)](https://stackoverflow.com/a/63046817/2345325).
